This data management project in **Python** is intended to conduct a supply chain analysis of *three key ingredients* required in the making of **a high-quality avocado toast**, namely:

- Avocado
- Olive Oil
- Sourdough


The fundamental goal of this data management work is to communicate an in-depth understanding of the complex supply chain taking part in producing a simple and single dish.

### Data Sources

Three key pairs of datasets were utilised in this project for each of the three key ingredients. If we take into account avocados for instance, 

- avocado.csv has detailed information about *avocados*, including various nutritional information, country of origin
- relevant_avocado_categories.csv has detailed information 


### Tools

- [Anaconda Navigator: ](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
  - To access the Jupyter Notebook or **Python**
