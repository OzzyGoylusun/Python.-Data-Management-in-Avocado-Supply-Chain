This data management project in **Python** is intended to conduct a supply chain analysis of *three key ingredients* required in the making of **a high-quality avocado toast**, namely:

- Avocado
- Olive Oil
- Sourdough
  
The fundamental goal of this data management work is to highlight some aspects of the complex supply chain taking part in producing a simple and single dish.

### Data Sources

Three key pairs of datasets were utilised in this project for each of the three key ingredients. For instance, if we are to take into account avocados, 

- avocado.csv has detailed information about *the avocados*, including a variety of its products, nutritional info, country of origin and destination and so on/
- relevant_avocado_categories.csv merely contains the category tags of interest related to *the avocados*. 


### Tools
