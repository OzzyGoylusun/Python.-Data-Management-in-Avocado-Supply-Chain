This data management project in **Python** is intended to conduct a supply chain analysis of *three key ingredients* required in the making of **a high-quality avocado toast**, namely:

- Avocado
- Olive Oil
- Sourdough
  
The fundamental goal of this data management work is to highlight some aspects of the complex supply chain taking part in producing a simple and single dish.

### Data Sources

Three key pairs of datasets were utilised in this project for each of the three key ingredients. For instance, if we are to take into account avocados, 

- avocado.csv has detailed information about *the avocados*, including a variety of its products, nutritional info, country of origin and destination and so on/
- relevant_avocado_categories.csv merely contains the category tags of interest related to *the avocados*. 


### Tools

- [Anaconda Navigator: ](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
  - To access the Jupyter Notebook for **Python**


### Data Preparation

The following data preparation tasks were undertaken:

1. All datasets were first inspected before deciding how to load each dataset:
  - This involved determining which **read function**, available in Pandas or in the generic Python library, would suit best and what parameters (i.e., delimiters, headers, spacing) the pre-determined functions shall have taken.

2. Afterwards, seeing that the contents of all .csv files' are relatively large, a subset of columns were  pre-emptively utilised to be passed to each DataFrame to scale down the size.

3. In order to answer numerious questions, a variety of data manipulation tasks also needed to be completed (e.g., splitting some category tags of a string type for each row and passing them onto another DataFrame column as a list to traverse through)
